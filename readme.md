MADE BY PARTH ADSUL in supervision of SANKET SIR

++PROJECT OBJECTIVE++

    To build a menu-driven academic management system that:
    1.Manages student details (CRUD operations)
    2.Records and updates student grades
    3.Calculates semester GPA
    4.Stores data persistently using text files
    5.Exports grade data to Excel

This app is made for student and grade management by python3.0   

++Student Management Module++

    1.Add New Student
    2.Validates Student ID (STU001 format)
    3.Checks unique email
    4.Validates DOB (DD/MM/YYYY)
    5.Saves data to students3.txt

++Search Student++

    1.Search by Student ID
    2.Displays complete student details

++Update Student++

    Allowed updates:
    1.Email
    2.Program
    3.Status (Active / Inactive / Graduate)

++View All Students++

 Displays all students in tabular format    

++Grade Management Module++
    Add Grade Entry

    1.Student ID must exist
    2.Validates:
    3.Assessment type
    4.Marks range
    5.Semester (1st–8th)


++View Student Grades++

    1.Displays all grades of a student
    2.Shows marks, percentage, and semester

++Update Grade++

    1.Updates marks for a student
    2.Re-validates marks before saving
 
++Excel Export Feature++

    1.Exports all grade records to marks.xlsx
    2.Columns include:
        Student ID
        Subject
        Assessment Type
        Marks Obtained
        Maximum Marks
        Semester 

++Validations Implemented++

    1.Student ID format validation
    2.Unique Student ID & Email
    3.Date validation
    4.Marks validation (0 ≤ marks ≤ max marks)
    5.Semester validation (1st to 8th)
    6.Assessment type validation      

++Future Enhancements++

    1.Class & subject performance reports
    2.Excel import feature
    3.GUI using Streamlit  

++Conclusion++

The Student Grade Management System is a complete, functional Python application demonstrating real-world programming  concepts like:

    1.CRUD operations
    2.File persistence
    3.GPA calculations
    4.Excel export
